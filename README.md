# Platforms
This is an animation I made based on a screenprint I made. I used the Snap.svg library (available at http://snapsvg.io/) to manipulate shapes that were originally screenprinted onto paper.

Click the shapes to animate. If you click them twice they do some cool glitching, which I would like to explore further.

I am working on a way to optimize my solution so the movement is not so slow with multiple shapes moving.

More documentation in the near future..
